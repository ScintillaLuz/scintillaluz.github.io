There was a time when I anxiously waited for a printer's call to go an pick up a pack of fresh prints. There was another time after that, when I learned everything I could about pixels and CSS preprocessing. Here's the story of how I walked out of traditional graphic design to work in tech.

You can see a selection of my print and branding work collected here. I keep my early UI experiments and icons on my Dribbble.

### My story

In 2010 I went back to **Italy**, after graduating in Book Design at the Department of Typography of the University of Reading, England. That autumn, as I was holding a fresh degree in my hands the iPad crashed the book market, and changed things forever. I landed a graphic design job at a tiny snazzy magazine in Milan called ZERO, and in six months I was my most miserable self.

I knew drawing being the centre of my life since I was four. I picked art in high school, and dropped out of Fine Arts Academy after one year. I found design, and a more challenging environment at The Politecnico in Milan. There started my love affair with vectors, and a long-term relationship with the Bauhaus principles and typography. I studied and worked, and got inebriated sniffing freshly printed offset ink.

Traditional graphic design jobs meant a lot of compromises, especially with in-agency clients work. The Milan magazine's gig was the last chapter in my career as a print-focused designer. I wanted to be on the forefront of innovation, working on products used by thousands (millions?) of people every single day. I wanted to participate in a culture of sharing, where contributing meant growth for all. That was for me the Web.

I devoured anything I could find online. I built news skills capitalizing on my design method foundations. I took big risks â€” I co-founded a startup, got funding and moved to Berlin without ever being in the city before. I matured as a web designer, and made terrible mistakes as a manager. I taught myself everything I needed to be proficient in HTML & CSS, with precious help from programmers closest to me. I failed and crashed and looked at the ashes all around me, panicked and then thought "this is good." The company did not survive, but I understood that was irrelevant. Even arrogant.

I moved on. I exerted resilience.

Now I am a product designer based in Oakland, California. I am currently working at Bandcamp, designing experiences to make music lovers and artists happy.
