#### What was the project about?
Up until gift cards, selling has been exclusively limited to artists. For the first time, this was changing, and Bandcamp would start selling its own product to fans. The project’s brief detailed the complex accounting behind the scenes, and restricted the first version to digital cards only.

Revenues, payouts, and fraud prevention posed a challenge, but the idea “was well-known and simple”: folks would come to the site to buy a gift card for a friend or partner, the giftee would redeem the said card and spend their credit in music and merchandise. Launch was a few days before Christmas.


#### What was I asked to do?
1. Art direct illustrations for the cards, choosing artists and coordinating their work
2. Submit a strategy for implementation, so to meet the Christmas deadline
3. Design UX/UI of gift card purchase, card redemption, purchase with gift card credit


### Art Direction
Instagram has been both my source of distraction and exposure to great independent artists. Through that I found several interesting profiles for commissioning illustrations. We wanted some pattern-like art, and to cover as many musical moods as possible. The style had to be in line with Bandcamp’s visual direction — pop, colorful, urban.

Once we got all the illustrations in, we realised we missed a truly metal card, so I hit up yet another artist to complete the collection&hellip;

We commissioned a total of 12 illustrations, from the following artists: <a style="color: #9c9c9b; border-bottom: 1px solid #9c9c9b;" href="https://www.instagram.com/tomabbisssmithart/">Tom Abbiss Smith</a> (UK), <a style="color: #9c9c9b; border-bottom: 1px solid #9c9c9b;" href="https://www.instagram.com/elisamacellari/">Elisa Macellari</a> (Italy), <a style="color: #9c9c9b; border-bottom: 1px solid #9c9c9b;" href="https://www.instagram.com/gaurabthakali/?hl=en">Gaurab Thakali</a> (UK), <a style="color: #9c9c9b; border-bottom: 1px solid #9c9c9b;" href="https://www.instagram.com/camperksillustration/">Camilla Perkins</a> (UK), <a style="color: #9c9c9b; border-bottom: 1px solid #9c9c9b;" href="http://www.zansky.com.br/">Zansky</a> (Brasil), <a style="color: #9c9c9b; border-bottom: 1px solid #9c9c9b;" href="https://www.instagram.com/rayatheink/">R .

### Project Management

###### The Old Ways

Until recently, the way we’ve done design at Bandcamp one single designer would take over an entire feature, from beginning to end. Teams have always be very compact, with an average of two developers working on implementation. In the first phase of the design process, I would usually iterate through a series of proposals, refining them with the feedback of my lead. Once we’d agreed on a solution, we would ask management’s approval. I would then move onto writing the technical specs, handing them to the rest of the team, and walking them through the plan.

For the gift cards, I began listing the feature’s minimum requirements, and outlining its ramifications. How many parts of Bandcamp are affected by this feature? What are the implications on the artist side? And on the fan side? The feature was reaching wide, touching purchase flow, sign up, email notifications, and artist payouts.

###### Hitting the Deadline

The tight deadline asked for a change in the way we worked. Leaving devs waiting until I would deliver a colossal spec inclusive of all the flows would have never gotten us online in time. We wanted the team to get started right away, modelling the underlying infrastructure first, and moving the frontend later.


##### New Strategy

**1. Split the process into (3) blocks**
* Blocks: 1) Gift card purchase, 2) Card redemption, 3) Gift card balance purchase.
* Before doing any design work, I would outline of the general structural decisions for each block. These initial specs would answer questions such as _In which ways buyers will share the gift card?_ or _What would happen when a fan gets gift cards in different currencies?_
* This blueprint would be passed onto to the engineers, so they could get started with infrastructure, and eventually come back with feedback about points of friction.

**2. Design & implement block by block**
* I would treat each block as an independent sub-project, working on design solutions, getting approval and then submitting the specs for review and implementation.
* Engineers would be able to attack the first block without waiting any longer.
* Because we defined the general structure in the previous step, we had a good overview of the connections between the three main blocks of the feature.

**3. Create a separate funnel for the gift card purchase**
* Engineers would look into streamlining the the gift card purchase flow.
* Separation ensured the gift card purchase would be completed in two steps maximum.
* The goals were limiting drop offs and keeping the focus on the user’s original intention.<br/>
