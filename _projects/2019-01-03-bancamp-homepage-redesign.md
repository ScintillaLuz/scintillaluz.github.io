#### What were we doing, and why?

By the time I started the redesign, Bandcamp’s homepage was divided in seven sections, plus a fat footer. With more than 600,000 artists and 3,500 independent labels, the homepage represented the heart of our music discovery, tipping fans on where to look for the interesting stuff. The first section from the top hosted our weekly radio show – The Bandcamp Weekly. Following was a real time sales feed, then two sections with curated highlights. Quick reviews of new releases were combined with excerpts of longer articles from our blog. Below was the automated section with the top selling music. The discovery ended here, and the page continued promoting fans and a CTA for artists and buyers.

In 2016 the newly formed editorial team launched the Bandcamp Daily, an independent music publication on a mission to shine lights on the diverse world of Bandcamp’s artists. The magazine was forged as the fans' guide into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/music/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html">“one of the greatest underground-culture bazaars of our time”</a>. Ambitious and unconventional, completely free from the pressure of advertisement, the Daily now represented Bandcamp’s core values. The blog was archived, and more than half of the homepage was suddenly obsolete. The old structure was to be replaced with a showcase of the Daily's headlines.


#### What was I asked to do?

* Redesign the first half of our homepage, to fit a showcase of the Daily’s features.
* Design the flow for populating the homepage with editorial content.
* Design the dashboard for managing the homepage content's upload and organization.


### 1. Homepage Redesign

###### _The Previous Homepage_

The intention for the main banner was to fit three/four of our newest Daily headlines, together with the latest Weekly show. Editors and writers would be in charge of choosing the headlines for the day, and the order in which they would be shown.

The Weekly would be automatically updated every Tuesday, taking the front spot on the day of its release. The following sections — highlights on new releases, links to music articles on our blog, and the app promo — needed to go away and be re-designed. Scrolling down, we wanted to continue promoting editorial content, showing a number of older Daily articles, previously featured in the top banner. From the top selling below, the page should have stayed the same.

Here’s the first half of the former homepage (2016). I’ve highlighted the 4 sections that would be later redesigned, and what we were to substitute them with. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/625kgbppyz692tp/Full%20Old%20Homepage.jpg?dl=0">See the image in full here.</a>

</div>

#### The New Layout

###### _The Carousel_

The first step was to take the grid and repurpose it, making hierarchies clear at first sight. I submitted drafts for what we started to call _the carousel_ — the banner area above the fold. The proposals explored opposing approaches: animated vs static, interactive vs fixed. The common baseline was blowing up a single photograph to occupy the full width. The Daily would commission photo shoots, and we wanted the visual aspect to be leading.

</div>


###### _The Daily News_

Scrolling down, I adopted a _modular approach_. Older Daily news would be grouped into smaller cards, using the same grid of the “New and Notable” recommendations below. Introducing this section named “Bandcamp Daily”, would be a larger module linking to the Album of the Day review. Much more than just a collection of _you-might-have-missed-this_ articles, this should still tickle fans’ interest in our editorial curation.
