#### What were we doing, and why?

By the time I started the redesign, Bandcamp’s homepage was divided in seven sections, plus a fat footer. With more than 600,000 artists and 3,500 independent labels, the homepage represented the heart of our music discovery, tipping fans on where to look for the interesting stuff. The first section from the top hosted our weekly radio show – The Bandcamp Weekly. Following was a real time sales feed, then two sections with curated highlights. Quick reviews of new releases were combined with excerpts of longer articles from our blog. Below was the automated section with the top selling music. The discovery ended here, and the page continued promoting fans and a CTA for artists and buyers.

In 2016 the newly formed editorial team launched the Bandcamp Daily, an independent music publication on a mission to shine lights on the diverse world of Bandcamp’s artists. The magazine was forged as the fans' guide into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/music/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html">“one of the greatest underground-culture bazaars of our
time”</a>. Ambitious and unconventional, free from the pressure of relying on advertisement, the Daily represented Bandcamp’s core values to the outside world. Once we archived the blog, more than half of the homepage was suddenly obsolete. Daily’s headlines would take its place, as the opener of our most important landing page.


#### What was I asked to do?

* Redesign the first half of our homepage, to fit a showcase of the Daily’s features.
* Design the flow for populating the homepage with editorial content.
* Design the dashboard for managing the homepage content's upload and organization.


### Homepage Redesign

###### _The Previous Homepage_

The intention for the main banner was to fit three/four of our newest Daily headlines, together with the latest Weekly show. Editors and writers would be in charge of choosing the headlines for the day, and the order in which they would be shown.

The Weekly would be automatically updated every Tuesday, taking the front spot on the day of its release. The following sections — highlights on new releases, links to music articles on our blog, and the app promo — needed to go away and be re-designed. Scrolling down, we wanted to continue promoting editorial content, showing a number of older Daily articles, previously featured in the
top banner. From the top selling below, the page should have stayed the same.

</div>

<p style="font-size: 85%; color: #9c9c9b; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px; font-style: italic;"> Here’s the first half of the former homepage (2016). I’ve highlighted the 4 sections that would be later redesigned, and what we were to substitute them with. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/625kgbppyz692tp/Full%20Old%20Homepage.jpg?dl=0">See the image in full here.</a>

#### The "Carousel"

The first step was to take the grid and repurpose it, making hierarchies clear at first sight. I submitted drafts for what we started to call _**the carousel**_ — the banner area above the fold. The proposals explored opposing approaches: animated vs static, interactive vs fixed. The stylistic trait in common was to blow up a single photograph to occupy the full width. The Daily would commission photo shoots, and we wanted the visual aspect to be leading.

###### _Early Proposals_

Following my usual workflow, I went through a series of iterations, to present the proposals I believed in the most. Trying to define a visual language that would speak to our audience, I played with big headlines on flat-colored backgrounds, and a centered aligned slideshow. These two series of mockups did not make the cut.



<p style="font-size: 85%; color: #9c9c9b; margin-top: 30px; font-style: italic;">I really loved both these versions, but fat slideshows with big pictures are not always the right answer (read: performances and engagement.)</a>

#### Other Daily News, New & Notable

Scrolling down, I adopted a _modular approach_. Older Daily news would be grouped into smaller cards, using the same grid of the “New and Notable” recommendations below. Introducing this section named “Bandcamp Daily”, would be a larger module linking to the Album of the Day review. Much more than just a collection of _you-might-have-missed-this_ articles, this should still tickle fans’ interest in our editorial curation.

#### Autocomplete

###### _A Two Days Hack_

Every year Bandcamp’s distributed team come together to spend a week catching up, IRL style. Usually working from our home offices, we get the chance to discover who’s actually very tall, and break the video chat habits. At 2017's The Gathering me and Alexandra Hindley — lead developer for the Music Labels team — took over a 48-hours mini project, bringing autocomplete in the search bar to life. Alex on the backend, and me on UI design and front-end, we shipped the last detail of the Homepage redesign.
